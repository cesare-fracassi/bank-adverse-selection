README for Replication Package

Paper Title: Adverse Selection in Corporate Loan Markets

This README file provides information for the replication package of the paper accepted for publication in the Journal of Finance.

The replication package includes Stata code that creates all tables and figures presented in the main paper and the internet appendix.

We have provided a Stata log file that includes the results of running the code on the actual data. This log file allows you to view the output from the original analysis.

The original data used in this study is confidential and cannot be shared publicly.

To facilitate replication efforts, we have created a pseudo-dataset in accordance with the Journal of Finance guidelines. This pseudo-dataset can be used to run the code and reproduce the structure of the tables and figures.  Please note that this is not the actual data used in the paper; therefore, results obtained from this pseudo-dataset will differ from those presented in the publication. To ensure consistency with the final results and to facilitate smooth execution, including the propensity score matching analysis, however, we have artificially adjusted correlations among certain variables. The code to create this pseudo-dataset is also included in the package.

To use the replication package:
a. Ensure that you update all directory paths to match your local file structure.
b. Run the pseudo-data creation code first or use the pseudo data already provided.
c. Execute the main analysis code to reproduce tables and figures.
